# CodingChallengeRepository

This repository is my personal space for storing solutions to coding challenges I've tackled. Each solution is implemented in C#.

## Structure

- **Single Console Application:** All challenge solutions are contained within a single project named `CodingChallenges`.
- **Folders and Files:** Solutions are organized by challenge name, with each challenge having its own C# file for clarity and ease of navigation.

## Note to Self

This repository serves as a reference and a way to track my progress over time. It's a collection of my efforts to solve various programming problems, organized in a way that makes sense to me.

Remember, the goal is to learn and improve, so revisiting and refactoring old solutions is part of the process.
